==================================

Model can be tested using included benchmarks.
Model can be troubleshooted with constant power production and removal blocks.
After new developments run benchmarks and frequancy analysis to varify model.
If model fails due to singularity issues squeeze the tolerance by reducing ts_max or run with a stiff solver. 

==================================

Updates 
[7/19/2021] - A bug was found in Reactivity module where circulation loss was missing. Bug was fixed. Benchmarks and Transients were updated with Matlab R2021a. A new file was added with Matlab R2019b simulink.
