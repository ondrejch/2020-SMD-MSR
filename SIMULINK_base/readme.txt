==================================

Model can be tested using included benchmarks.
Model can be troubleshooted with constant power production and removal blocks.
After new developments run benchmarks and frequancy analysis to varify model.
If model fails due to singularity issues squeeze the tolerance by reducing ts_max or run with a stiff solver.
